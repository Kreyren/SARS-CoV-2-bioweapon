# SARS-CoV-2-bioweapon
Repository dedicated to gather relevant data about the theory of SARS-CoV-2 being a bioweapon or leaked experiment

## Relevants
1. MUDr. Soňa Peková, PhD. is expert on molecular genetics in Czech republic with alma mater on Lékařská fakulta Univerzity Karlovy in Hradci Králové(https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%C5%88a_Pekov%C3%A1)
1.1. She believes that SARS-CoV-2 has been created in a labolatory(5).

2. There is an institute in China that allegedly studied SARS-CoV-1 in hubei province at the time of the outbreak(6)
2.1. Were they researching SARS-CoV-1 in such a way that could cause this outbreak?
2.2. Did they develop this intentionally?

3. Chinese bat women? https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/

4. MOTIVE: China's young generation is calling the older generation "Evil uncles" for political reasons -> This may be a motive for creating SARS-CoV-2 assuming it having a higher mortality rate in the elderly.

5. MOTIVE: There is an ongoing trade war in between china and USA where there is a posibility of China releasing such "bioweapon" to increase their profits and reduce the ongoing issue with overpopulation. -> Would they do it? (assuming unlikely)
5.1. How can you ensure this being controllable? -> They could have a cure?
