DISCLAIMER: This is my personal research in the theory that was initiated by [MUDr. Soňa Peková, PhD.](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%C5%88a_Pekov%C3%A1) in Czech republic as seen on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7oEmuVrH0.
This research should NOT be quoted since it is unlikely to be trueth and license itself prohibits it.

# SARS-CoV-2-bioweapon
Repository dedicated to gather relevant data about the theory of SARS-CoV-2 being a bioweapon or leaked experiment

## Relevants and conclusions
1. MUDr. Soňa Peková, PhD. is expert on molecular genetics in Czech republic with alma mater on Lékařská fakulta Univerzity Karlovy in Hradci Králové(https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/So%C5%88a_Pekov%C3%A1)<br>
1.1. She believes that SARS-CoV-2 has been created in a labolatory(5).

2. There is an institute in China that allegedly studied SARS-CoV-1 in hubei province at the time of the outbreak(6)<br>
2.1. Were they researching SARS-CoV-1 in such a way that could cause this outbreak?<br>
2.1.1. Based on **untrusted** sources Wuhan CDC was researching SARS-CoV-2 at the time of the outbreak.
2.2. Did they develop this intentionally? -> Possible, but very unlikely

3. Chinese bat women? https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/

4. **MOTIVE:** China's young generation is calling the older generation "Evil uncles" for political reasons -> This may be a motive for creating SARS-CoV-2 assuming it having a higher mortality rate in the elderly.<br>
4.1. Unlikely(?)

5. **MOTIVE:** There is an ongoing trade war in between china and USA where there is a posibility of China releasing such "bioweapon" to increase their profits and reduce the ongoing issue with overpopulation. -> Would they do it? (assuming unlikely)<br>
5.1. How can this be ensurable for this being controllable?
5.1.1 They could have a cure? -> Possible assuming that the situation is under control as of 06.04.2020 where citizens woudn't know what are they being treated with.
5.1.2 Crown-controll to controlled spread? -> Unlikely(?)
5.1.3 China has problems with over-population, crowd-control with spread controlled depending on region might be acceptable for them assuming uncontrollable spread?

6. **MOTIVE(?):** China, Russia and Iranian media allegedly spreads the info about USA creating SARS-CoV-2 [10](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/03/iran-and-russian-media-push-bioweapon-conspiracies-amid-covid19-outbreak/163669/) -> Why would they do that?

13. Australian scientis was able to recreate SARS-CoV-2 in a lab(?) - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51289897 (old source, seems to be the first who claimed this theory)
- The phrasing seems very odd, apparently they were able to cultive it for further research **not** recreating it from scratch
